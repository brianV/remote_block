Follow the standard Drupal module installation process
to install this module.

You will need to upgrade to the latest 
version of jQuery Update (2.0-beta1 as of this writing) before
you may use the module, since it depends on jQuery features that
were introduced later than the version of jQuery in D6 core.

Note that this is a development release, and the code would need
to be modified to suit specific use cases on your site.

Please read the security warning if your site has blocks with
access restrictions on it.

The demo files give examples of how the embedding works. 
The module's first tagged release is projected to have an embed
code generation form in it.
