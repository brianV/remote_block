Follow the standard Drupal module installation process
to install this module.

You will need to upgrade to the latest 
version of jQuery Update (2.0-beta1 as of this writing) before
you may use the module, since it depends on jQuery features that
were introduced later than the version of jQuery in D6 core.

(Note that some Drupal modules which include JS may not yet be
compatible with jQuery > 1.3.)

This is a development release, and the code would need
to be modified to suit specific use cases on your site.

The demo files give examples of how the embedding works. 

SECURITY WARNING:
This module does not currently do any security checking on the blocks
that can be embedded, beyond the checking for the "access content" permission. 
Currently I am not aware of a way to properly check to ensure that 
arbitrary blocks can be viewed by anonymous users, as would be the case 
on third-party sites, while maintaining strict security.

You should be careful in enabling this module or else 
private data might be exposed.
